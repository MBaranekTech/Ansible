# Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that enables you to configure systems, deploy applications, and orchestrate IT infrastructure using simple, human-readable YAML playbooks. 
It connects to remote machines over SSH and doesnâ€™t require agents, making it lightweight and easy to manage.
